SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Module to quickly install and configure PowerShell Core Remoting over 
    SSH

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The module was designed to Install PowerShell Core with Install-PSCore,
    Install OpenSSH with Install-OpenSSH, and Configure OpenSSH to be used 
    for PowerShell Remoting with Add-OpenSSHToPath and Update-OpenSSHConfig

SETUP PSCOREREMOTING
    The module comes with a helper script to help quickly run through the
    install and uninstall processes. It includes switches to quickly invoke
    the commands in the module in a single command.

BACKGROUND
    When writing this module I was working on a lab for a workshop where
    I was using Linux to PSRemote to Windows. I encountered issues caused
    by a bug that required a large amount of trial and error to find a 
    working configuration. This module was quickly written to make this
    process faster.
